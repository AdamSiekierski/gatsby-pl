title: Organize a Gatsby Event
---

Our communiy event support offerings and process are undergoing some changes. Check back soon to see our updated community event support opportunities!

## What constitutes a Gatsby event?

A community-organized Gatsby event can be a local meetup, a small conference, a “lunch and learn” with coworkers, or a larger event - as long as **it includes at least one Gatsby-focused presentation or discussion**. It’s up to you how many people you want to invite and how casual the environment. You can organize an event at your workplace or for the local community.

Events are evaluated on a weekly basis. If your submission is approved, you will receive an email with instructions for receiving event support and other guidance.
If you have any questions, please send them to events@gatsbyjs.com.
